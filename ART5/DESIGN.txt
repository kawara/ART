ART5 (Autonomous Robot Toy version 5) combines the following:

- Mechanical four wheel vehicule based on a toy RC for propulsion and chassis
- Arduino Microcontroller  platform for communication and decisions
- CPLD for low-level sensor data acquisition and motor control
- RF communication to/from PC for debugging and visualization
- Processing-based dashboard on the PC.

RF communication solution is for telemetry and has been selected to be low-bandwidth, medium-range, low-power and inexpensive.
