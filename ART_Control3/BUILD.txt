To build this robot toy car, you will need:

Components:

-an RC car (67RMB, http://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=7905841099)
-an additional battery, to the one that comes with the RC car, rechargeable Ni-Cd 400mAh/6V battery pack 
-an Arduino (any should do, we use the Dueminalove)
-a pile of cables with pins
-one or more ranging sensor of some kind (infrared such as Sharp IR or Ultrasonic such as the Parallax Ping)
-a small breadboard
-an IC with at least 4 transistors (such as the ULN2803APG) or 4 NPN transistors 
-two AA battery (to test the RF transmitter)
-possibly a small servo-motor  to rotate ranging sensor

Tools:
-a USB cable (standard USB transfer cable)
-a PC (Mac, Linux or Windows)
-Arduino software
-a Dremel or its Chinese copy equivalent
-a wire stripper
-some tape
-a marker (Sharpie permanent marker)
-a ruler
-a set of precision screwdrivers
-some electric tape (or alternatively,   little name stickers...)
-four plastic bags for the screws you'll remove
-a soldering iron 
-a ballpen
-a camera for posterity!

Steps:

Charge your batteries 
* move to the next few steps that don't require battery while you wait (4 hours charge time)

Remove the plastic cover from the top of the car
* Turn over and start unscrewing starting with the back of the car
* Note that you may have to unscrew at an angle to get the screws furthest back out
* Keep the screws securely in a bag, organized by step
* 4 on the main plate, 2 in front, two for the lights
* Get the antenna from the cover (don't pull out too quickly - watch out for those thin wires connecting to the light)
* Put the cover on the side
* Remove the hot glue by melting it with soldering iron and a pair of tweezers 
* Remove the useless soudbox plastic box on top of the servo (3 screws)
* Screw the lights upside-down on the servo plastic box now available holes
* Tape the electric wires to the plastic frame

Test your car with the provided RF remote to verify that it does indeed still work

Take apart the remote
* twist the round plastic piece securing the antenna
* remove screws to open the case (6 screws)
* remove the screws holding down the board
* take care to mark which wire goes to source and ground (+ wire with the marker)
* unscrew the antenna

Create a new wood plate by tracing the various components and holes (don't forget the hole for the antenna)
* Dimension: 15cm wide by 25cm long (size of wood board is chosen to fit the board within the wheels)
* Use the right angle ruler: create an angle, measure desired width and height, trace box with marker

Remove the plastic plate on which the plastic cover was screwed
* Remove the four screws and then squeeze the hinges on the front of the plate to remove

Do the layout
* Figure out where to put the holes by overlaying the plastic plate on the board 
* To locate holes, remove the ballpoint from the pen body  
* Take all the electric components and place them on the new plate until satisfied with the layout
* Trace screwholes and the outline of parts for electronics
* Don't forget to leave a larger hole on the front of the plastic plate and to the left for the antenna to come out!

Cut the wood plate with the dremel
* Cut rectangle
* Break off rectangle
* Sand edges of rectangle
* Drill holes into the wood plate with the dremel
* Verify alignment with plastic plate
* Test alignment with antenna

Assemble mechanical parts
* Put back the plastic plate on the car
* Tie-wrap the wood plate to the plastic plate
* Tie-wrap the components to the wood board

Assemble electronics
* Connect wires to/from the various components (except the battery)

Place the sensor(s)
* Make sure the sensors are physically very well aligned

Write basic Arduino program
* Start Arduino IDE
* Write basic Arduino program
* Connect to USB
* Upload

Test your robot
* transmitter light comes on 
* sensor obstacle detection works
* Test that motor control works
* Turn on the car, manually trigger the sensor
* Put it on the ground and let it fly! (don't forget to get it on video!)

Other
* Use version control (github.com or code.google.com) to keep source and documentation
